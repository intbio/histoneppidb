## Description
Histone Protein Protein Interactions Database - a database that collects publicly available datasets of experimental and predicted evidence about histone – non-histone interactions from STRING, BioGRID, and IntAct. In DB are used both updated and previous HGNC symbols for all human histone genes. Protein-protein interactions are aggregated for histone variants. Also, DB contains a designed functional hierarchical classification for chromatin proteins and PDB ID to the related structures. The databased are linked with Histone variants from [HistoneDB 2.0](https://histonedb.bioeng.ru/browse/) and with structural information from [NuclDB](https://nucldb.intbio.org/).
This database contributes to revealing of a complex network of interactions between nucleosomes and chromatin proteins, many of which are specific to the histone composition of the nucleosome.
## Release
March 2021: HistonePPI DB version 1 (String v11, BioGRID v4.3., IntAct v 4.2.16??)
